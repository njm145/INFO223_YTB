A website is important part of running a business wanting to expand, it can provide essential marketing in a world where the internet has almost
completely replaced the phone book as the place to go when you are looking for a business to have work done. The added function for this website
that the owner Andy requires is the ability for his customers to be able to look at a map of coverage for his business and type in their email to
get confirmation whether they are able to hire Andy or not. If not they need to able to enter their email and then be able to recieve an email 
when their area has coverage from Andy's cleaning business as it expands in size.
